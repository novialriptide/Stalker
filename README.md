# Stay Alert
A pygame horror game using SakuyaEngine v3

## Build From Source
1. Install [SakuyaEngine](https://github.com/novialriptide/SakuyaEngine)
2. Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install dependencies
3. Run `src/main.py`

## How To Play
Survive the night from 12AM to 6AM. Scare away the intruder using your flashlight and use sound cues to detect where the intruder is trying to get in. A random light source might also appear which represents where the intruder is trying to enter. (ex: frontdoor, backdoor, window). You can also board up windows to barricade the intruder. 

The stalker's online alias is `thebluecap3` and is communicating you through your phone. He might hint where he is trying to break in next through your phone.
