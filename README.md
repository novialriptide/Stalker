## How To Play
Survive the night until the police arrive, you live in the countryside, so it'll take 10 minutes for the local police to arrive. Scare away the intruder using your flashlight and use sound cues to detect where the intruder is trying to get in. A random light source might also appear which represents where the intruder is trying to enter. (ex: frontdoor, backdoor, window). You can also board up windows to barricade the intruder. 

The stalker's online alias is `thebluecap3` and is communicating you through your phone. He might hint where he is trying to break in next through your phone.

If the intruder eventually breaks into your home, you can only hide from him. You can hide under your bed, closet, etc, but you can only delay until the police arrive. The intruder can also hear you so if you're in a radius, the intruder will come after that sound.
